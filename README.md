# Altar

Commenting tool for audio / image / video / (3d object ?)

## RoadMap :
- [x] Timeline comment for audio
- [ ] Image markers comment
- [ ] Timeline + Image comment for Video
- [ ] WYSIWYG comment text editor
- [ ] Custom style for comments (for now in the timeline & image markers)
- [ ] Handle 3D Object (probably need ThreeJS dependency)
